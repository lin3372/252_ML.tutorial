Update the tutorial to use a different tabular dataset, perhaps from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).\n","* **[Use Functional API](https://machinelearningmastery.com/keras-functional-api-deep-learning/)**. Update the tutorial to use the Keras Functional API for defining the model (see this [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/keras-functional-api-deep-learning/))."],"metadata":{"id":"KTPAfMeeAFWM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Related Tutorials\n","\n","* [5 Step Life-Cycle for Neural Network Models in Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/5-step-life-cycle-neural-network-models-keras/)\n","* [Multi-Class Classification Tutorial with the Keras Deep Learning Library](https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-class-classification-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library/)\n","* [Regression Tutorial with the Keras Deep Learning Library in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library-python/)\n","* [How to Grid Search Hyperparameters for Deep Learning Models in Python With Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/grid-search-hyperparameters-deep-learning-models-python-keras/)"],"metadata":{"id":"Friol9PKBk68"}}]}
